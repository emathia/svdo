An html snippet that has the sentence from the student with the subject, verb, direct object and any prepositional phrases in different spans with subject, verb, direct_object, prep_phrases class tags. 2.  A corrected sentence with the same types of span tags. 3.  Instructions that tells the student what to change to go from student sentence to corrected sentence and why.
